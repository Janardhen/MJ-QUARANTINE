### Self Evaluation

Meeting the following criteria earns a D or better grade; failing to meet these criteria earns an F grade:
- [x]  D-1: The repository link is submitted to Canvas before the project deadline.

- [x] D-2: The repository contains a README.md file in its top-level directory.

- [x] D-3: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of M or less.

Meeting all previous criteria as well as the following earns a C or better grade:

- [x] C-1: Your repository is well-formed, with an appropriate .gitignore file and no unnecessary files tracked.

- [x] C-2: Your release is tagged using semantic versioning where the major version is zero, the minor version is the iteration number, and the patch version is 
incremented as usual for each change made to the minor version, and the release name matches the release tag.

- [x] C-3: You have a clear legal right to use all incorporated assets, and the licenses for all third-party assets are tracked in the README.md file.

- [x] C-4: The README.md contains instructions for how to play the game or such instructions are incorporated into the game itself.

- [x] C-5: The project content is eligible for an ESRB Rating of T or less.

- [x] C-6: The game is stable and includes some gameplay.

Meeting all previous criteria as well as the following earns a B or better grade:

- [x] B-1: The README.md file contains a personal reflection on the iteration and self-evaluation, as defined above.

- [x] B-2: The source code and project structure comply with our adopted style guides.

- [x] B-3: The game runs to a clear end state.

Meeting all previous criteria as well as the following earns an A grade:

- [x] A-1: The game includes a complete traditional player experience loop—title, gameplay, and ending—and the player has the option to play again.

I expect a B due to the course style.I have read the style guide and made some changes but still ain't sure with it.
